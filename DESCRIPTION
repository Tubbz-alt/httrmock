Version: 1.0.0
Author: G치bor Cs치rdi
Maintainer: G치bor Cs치rdi <csardi.gabor@gmail.com>
Description: Help make web API tests fast and reliable. The package operates
    in two modes: in record mode, it performs HTTP requests and records
    the responses in a database. In replay mode, it uses the recorded
    responses to perform the tests without calling making HTTP requests.
